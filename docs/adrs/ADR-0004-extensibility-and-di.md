# ADR-0004: Extensibility and Dependency Injection Architecture

## Status
Proposed â€“ pending Architecture Council review.

## Context
- The charts library must support third-party overlays, indicators, and analytics without forks.
- Host applications demand configurable telemetry, logging, and data feeds that vary per deployment.

## Decision
- Expose a plug-in registry within `src/VelloSharp.ChartEngine` allowing registration of new series renderers, analytics passes, and interaction tools.
- Plugins implement capability interfaces (`ISeriesRenderer`, `IIndicator`, `IInteractionTool`) and are resolved via dependency injection containers provided by host apps.
- Core services (rendering, data ingestion, diagnostics) request dependencies through constructor injection; default providers ship with the library but can be overridden.
- Rust engine surfaces extension points via FFI function tables; managed code loads dynamic plugins via reflection while ensuring type safety.

## Consequences
- Clear contracts empower partners to extend the engine while keeping the core stable.
- Additional validation is needed to prevent misbehaving plugins from destabilising the render loop.
- Documentation must clearly describe lifecycle expectations and threading rules for plugin authors.
