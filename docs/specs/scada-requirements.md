# SCADA Platform Requirements and Compliance Checklist

## Standards Alignment
- Adhere to ISA-101 (Human-Machine Interfaces for Process Automation) for layout hierarchy, color usage, and alarm depiction.
- Comply with IEC 62682 for alarm management lifecycle (prioritization, shelving, suppression, acknowledgement).
- Reference ISA 5.5 and IEC 60073 for color coding of alarm states, normal operations, and advisory indications.
- Maintain auditability per ISA 18.2: capture operator actions, command sources, and timestamps for compliance review.

## Functional Requirements
- Compose mixed dashboards integrating trend charts, analog/digital gauges, TreeDataGrid alarm/event lists, and annunciators using shared layout primitives.
- Support multi-screen control rooms with responsive layouts, docking, and zoom/pan surfaces; accommodate portrait HMI tablets.
- Provide historian playback, forward/back scrub, and slow-motion review for any bound signal with consistent UI feedback across widgets.
- Enable command workflows (setpoint changes, overrides, acknowledgements, inhibit/shelve) with confirmation prompts, validation, and operator attribution.
- Include scripting/extensibility (C#, Lua) for automation sequences, with sandboxing and validation hooks.

## Telemetry & Historian Expectations
- Telemetry channels use `TelemetryHub` with quality metadata (`Good`, `Uncertain`, `Bad`) and last-value caching via `ScadaTelemetryRouter`.
- Support high-rate ingestion (≥ 10k updates/sec aggregated) without exceeding shared 8 ms frame budget; batching and throttling strategies documented.
- Implement historian connectors for OPC UA, MQTT, REST, and file-based playback; ensure deterministic timestamps with timezone handling.
- Provide data retention policies and downsampling for long range trend views; accessible via shared query APIs.

## Alarm & Event Semantics
- Shared alarm engine must expose state machine hooks for `Normal`, `Unacknowledged`, `Acknowledged`, `Shelved`, `Suppressed`, `ReturnToNormal`.
- Visual hierarchy: alarms surfaced in annunciators (high severity), TDG lists (detailed view), and inline overlays (local indicators); consistent flashing cadence and sound cues.
- Commands for acknowledge/shelve/inhibit route through `CommandBroker` with operator identity and reason codes.
- Logging requirements: capture event timeline with millisecond precision; allow export and integration with external historian/event management.

## Performance & Reliability
- Render loop must maintain <8 ms CPU frame time and <30 ms end-to-end telemetry latency for critical signals.
- Support redundancy and failover: telemetry connectors expose heartbeat, failover triggers, and reconnection policies.
- Provide offline buffering for telemetry gaps (minimum 15 minutes) with visual indications of stale or replayed data.
- Include watchdog diagnostics: frame stats, command latency, connector health displayed in engineering panels and logged to observability pipeline.

## Security & Governance
- Role-based access control for dashboards and commands; integrate with existing identity providers (Active Directory, Azure AD, LDAP) via adapters.
- Require dual-operator confirmation for high-risk actions; support configurable policy definitions.
- Encrypt telemetry/command channels (TLS) and enforce certificate validation; document key rotation procedures.
- Record audit trail entries for login, command issuance, alarm acknowledgements, script execution, and configuration changes.

## Accessibility & Ergonomics
- UI must satisfy WCAG 2.1 AA for contrast, focus indicators, and keyboard navigation.
- Provide high-contrast/night mode palettes; allow per-operator scaling (125% – 200%) without layout breakage.
- Support screen readers and descriptive annunciations for alarm states (ARIA live region equivalents).
- Offer gesture alternatives for touch HMIs and ensure pointer targets ≥ 44 px with haptic/visual feedback.

## Deployment & Operations
- Package desktop hosts (WPF, WinUI, Avalonia) and web/embedded runtimes with consistent configuration model.
- Provide configuration-as-code support (YAML/JSON) for dashboards, connectors, alarm definitions; include validation CLI.
- Integrate monitoring: expose health metrics (Prometheus/OpenTelemetry) covering telemetry throughput, frame stats, command success.
- Deliver upgrade strategy with zero-downtime rolling updates for redundant deployments.
