# VelloSharp.Skia.Cpu

`VelloSharp.Skia.Cpu` provides a CPU-bound integration path between Vello and Skia, ideal for environments without GPU acceleration.

## Getting Started

1. Install with `dotnet add package VelloSharp.Skia.Cpu`.
2. Add `using VelloSharp.Skia.Cpu;` when configuring your rendering host.
3. Create the CPU surface bridge from this package and feed it with scenes generated by `VelloSharp` or higher-level components.
4. Tune the surface size, pixel format, and update cadence according to your applicationâ€™s performance targets.

## Usage Example

```csharp
using SkiaSharp;

var cpuSurface = SKSurface.Create(new SKImageInfo(400, 200));
cpuSurface.Canvas.DrawText("CPU sparse", 20, 120, new SKPaint { Color = SKColors.Black, TextSize = 48 });
cpuSurface.Flush();
```

## Next Steps

- Consult the API reference for the available surface adapters and tuning options.
- Combine the package with `VelloSharp.Charting` or `VelloSharp.Composition` to unlock CPU-only deployments.
