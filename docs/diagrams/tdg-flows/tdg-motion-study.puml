participant "GPU Presenter" as GPU
database "Data Adapter" as Data

== High-Velocity Scroll ==
U -> Host: PointerWheel(delta=+2400px/s)
Host -> Input: Enqueue(TdgPointerEvent)
Input -> Runtime: Dispatch pointer event (t=0ms)
Runtime -> Runtime: Update viewport + virtualization window\n(Δt = 0.9ms CPU)
Runtime -> Data: PrefetchAsync(hint=+2 pages) [async]
Runtime -> GPU: Submit scene diff (Δt = 2.4ms CPU, 3.0ms GPU)
GPU -> Host: Present frame (t=6.2ms, budget 8.33ms)
note right of GPU
Frame occupancy 74%; cache hits 92%.
end note

== Group Expand ==
U -> Host: PointerUp on expander
Host -> Input: Enqueue(TdgPointerEvent(kind=ExpandRequest))
Input -> Runtime: Dispatch expand (t=0ms)
Runtime -> Runtime: Materialize children (Δt = 1.1ms)
Runtime -> GPU: Submit morph animation (Δt = 1.9ms CPU, 2.5ms GPU)
Runtime -> Data: FetchAsync(child_window=32) [async, overlapped]
GPU -> Host: Present frame (t=6.0ms)
note right
Morph animation uses easing over 120Hz ticks (5 frames).
end note

== In-Place Edit Commit ==
U -> Host: KeyDown(Enter) within editable cell
Host -> Input: Enqueue(TdgKeyboardEvent(command=CommitEdit))
Input -> Runtime: Dispatch edit commit
Runtime -> Runtime: Apply optimistic patch (Δt = 0.8ms)
Runtime -> GPU: Submit scene diff (Δt = 1.6ms CPU, 2.1ms GPU)
Runtime -> Data: Push delta to adapter (Δt = 0.5ms async)
Data --> Runtime: Ack commit (t=12ms) [async]
Runtime -> GPU: No-op (state already reconciled)
GPU -> Host: Present frame (t=4.9ms)
note top of Data
Adapter returns validation status or patch rollback instructions.
end note
