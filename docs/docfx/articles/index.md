# VelloSharp Documentation

VelloSharp delivers a family of .NET libraries for GPU accelerated rendering, real-time data visualizations, and cross-platform UI integration. This site combines conceptual guides with full API reference generated from the source projects.

- Browse the *Libraries* section for getting started guides tailored to each package.
- Explore the *API Reference* area for namespace and member details generated directly from the builds.
- Follow the *DocFX Maintenance* guide to rebuild, preview, or clean the documentation artifacts locally.

The documentation is produced with DocFX during continuous integration, ensuring the content always matches the latest code in `main`.
