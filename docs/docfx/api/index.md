The API reference is generated from the source projects during every documentation build. Use the table of contents to navigate by namespace or search for specific types.

- All entries reflect the latest code on the `main` branch.
- Summaries and remarks are sourced from the XML documentation comments in the codebase.
- For release-specific information, refer to the package README files in the repository.
