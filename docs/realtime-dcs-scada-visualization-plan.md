# VelloSharp DCS/SCADA Real-Time Visualization Platform Plan

## Vision and Strategy
- Build a unified visualization platform for supervisory control (SCADA) and distributed control systems (DCS) that combines real-time charts, gauges, and hierarchical data grids over the shared Vello/VelloSharp composition stack.
- Deliver industrial-grade reliability, deterministic performance, and composable UX primitives that scale from embedded HMIs to control rooms and remote operations centers.
- Reuse the shared control toolkit (layouts, templated controls, text/shape atoms, input pipeline) to ensure consistent behaviour, theming, and accessibility across gauges, charting, TreeDataGrid, and future editors.
- Provide extensible runtime tooling for telemetry connectivity, alarm management, historian playback, scripting, and operator workflows.

## Implementation Conventions
- [ ] Native code organized under `ffi/scada-*` crates composing existing charting (`ffi/chart-*`), gauges (`ffi/gauges-*`), and composition (`ffi/composition`) modules.
- [ ] Managed surface delivered via `src/VelloSharp.Scada.*` assemblies referencing `VelloSharp.Charting`, `VelloSharp.Gauges`, and `VelloSharp.TreeDataGrid`.
- [ ] Shared assets (layout panels, templated controls, geometry/shape primitives, animation timelines, InputControl adapters) stay in common packages; any new cross-domain features update `docs/specs/shared-composition-contract.md`.
- [ ] Samples under `samples/VelloSharp.Scada.*` expose integrated dashboards with simulated and live telemetry connectors.

## Architectural Pillars
- **Unified Composition Stack**: Common layout, templated control, geometry/shape, text, and input building blocks consumed by charts, gauges, TDG, and SCADA-specific widgets.
- **Telemetry Fabric**: Shared data ingestion pipeline (OPC UA, MQTT, REST, gRPC) with buffering, historian playback, command routing, and security aligned with composition consumers.
- **Visualization Runtime**: Scene orchestration that merges chart panes, gauge panels, TDG views, and custom widgets using adaptive layouts and virtualization.
- **Alarms & Events**: Centralized alarm processing, annunciation, acknowledgement flows, and event journaling integrated into visual components.
- **Runtime Tooling & Extensibility**: Scriptable behaviours, dashboard authoring, templating, and hot-reload features for rapid operator workflows.
- **Deployment & Governance**: Distribution strategy across desktop/web/embedded, with security hardening, redundancy, and observability baked in.

## Phase 0 – Alignment, Inventory, and Requirements (2 weeks)
**Objectives**
- [ ] Inventory reusable components from charting, gauges, and TDG (layouts, controls, telemetry, animation) with gap analysis for SCADA workflows.
- [ ] Capture functional and compliance requirements (ISA-101, IEC 62682) in `docs/specs/scada-requirements.md`.
- [ ] Define telemetry/command contracts, historian expectations, and alarm semantics aligned with shared data models.
- [ ] Prototype an integrated dashboard combining charts, gauges, and TDG using existing samples to validate composition interoperability.

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Requirements dossier (`docs/specs/scada-requirements.md`) with compliance checklist.
- [ ] Component reuse matrix (`docs/specs/scada-component-inventory.md`) highlighting dependencies on charting, gauges, TDG.
- [ ] Prototype dashboard sample and performance trace stored in `docs/metrics/scada-baselines.md`.

## Phase 1 – Shared Platform Foundations (3–4 weeks)
**Objectives**
- [ ] Formalize the unified control toolkit: ensure `TemplatedControl`, `Panel`, `UserControl`, `Border`, `Decorator`, `Path`, `Button`, `CheckBox`, `RadioButton`, `DropDown`, `TabControl`, etc., behave consistently across modules.
- [ ] Extend shared layout virtualization to support SCADA floor plans and large overview displays (z-ordering, docking, snapped overlays).
- [ ] Integrate the shared `InputControl` base with SCADA-specific gestures (acknowledge, inhibit, override, drag drop) and keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] Establish cross-module styling/theming guidelines (day/night, alarm severity colors) and update design tokens.

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Updated shared composition contract documenting SCADA-specific extensions.
- [ ] Unified control toolkit validation suite (charts/gauges/TDG/SCADA) verifying behavioural parity.
- [ ] Theming guide (`docs/guides/scada-theming.md`) and token updates in shared styles.
- [ ] Input pipeline extensions with tests covering all control surfaces.

## Phase 2 – Telemetry, Historian, and Command Infrastructure (4 weeks)
**Objectives**
- [ ] Build shared telemetry adapters (OPC UA, MQTT, REST, Modbus over TCP) reusing charting/gauge connectors with SCADA-specific throttling, quality flags, and redundancy.
- [ ] Implement historian playback and recording services leveraging charting playback pipelines and gauge state snapshots.
- [ ] Define command routing/acknowledgement flows that integrate with gauges, chart overlays, and TDG editing surfaces.
- [ ] Provide security and auditing hooks (authentication, authorization, signed commands).

**Deliverables**
- [ ] `VelloSharp.Telemetry` service layer with connectors, failover, and quality metadata.
- [ ] Historian service with API + samples showing synchronized chart/gauge playback.
- [ ] Command/acknowledgement APIs and UI affordances (ack buttons, command dialogs) reusing shared templated controls.
- [ ] Security/audit logging documentation and tests.

## Phase 3 – Visualization & Dashboard Authoring (5 weeks)
**Objectives**
- [ ] Deliver a SCADA dashboard authoring experience combining charts, gauges, TDG, and custom widgets via drag/drop, templated layouts, and data binding.
- [ ] Add navigation primitives (mimic navigation, alarm list overlays, detail pop-outs) and view management (tabbed, tiled, video wall).
- [ ] Implement dynamic context linking (select item in TDG filters charts and gauges, alarm selection opens detail view).
- [ ] Provide responsive scaling for control rooms and mobile operators (multi-resolution layouts, reduced-motion options).

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Dashboard designer module (`src/VelloSharp.Scada.Designer`) with serialization to JSON/XAML-like descriptors.
- [ ] Runtime hosting surface with navigation, docking, alarm panes, and cross-component selection wiring.
- [ ] Samples demonstrating process overview, electrical one-line, and production monitoring dashboards.
- [ ] Documentation (`docs/guides/scada-dashboard-designer.md`) and quickstart tutorials.

## Phase 4 – Alarm & Event Management (3 weeks)
**Objectives**
- [ ] Centralize alarm detection, prioritization, shelving, and acknowledgement workflows aligned with ISA standards.
- [ ] Integrate alarm state into gauges (annunciators), charts (event markers), and TDG (alarm list) with consistent visuals.
- [ ] Provide alarm historian, audit trail, and analytics (rate of occurrence, response times).
- [ ] Support procedural guidance (checklists, SOPs) triggered by alarm events.

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Alarm engine module with APIs/maps to visualization components.
- [ ] Alarm list views using TDG, annunciator controls, and chart markers.

- [ ] SOP integration sample demonstrating operator guidance.

## Phase 5 – Runtime Tooling, Scripting, and Automation (3 weeks)

- [ ] Integrate rule-based and ML-driven analytics overlays (predictive maintenance highlights) using shared rendering hooks.
- [ ] Provide configuration management, versioning, and deployment packaging for dashboards and connectors.

**Deliverables**
- [ ] Script runtime with sandboxing, binding to charts/gauges/TDG components.
- [ ] Analytics overlay framework with examples (predictive trend, anomaly detection).
